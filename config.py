For each player, list their Elo or Elos as shown:

PLAYER_LIST = {'Player1': [2069, 2067],

               'Player6': [2021],
               }

It does not matter how many Elos you put in or if
there are different numbers of Elos for different
players.

The only restriction is that every player name
has to be unique and the number of players has
to be a multiple of TEAM_SIZE
